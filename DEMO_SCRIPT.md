# 🎤 JobReady.AI - Demo Script

**Estimated Time: 2 Minutes**

## 1. Introduction (30s)
"Hi, we are [Team Name]. We identified a huge problem: Students often don't know *why* they aren't getting hired. They have skills, but are they the *right* skills? 
Introducing **JobReady.AI**: An intelligent platform that detects skill gaps and builds a bridge to employment."

## 2. The Narrative / Live Demo (1m)
"Let's look at 'Alex', a fresh grad who wants to be a **Web Developer**."

* **(Show Landing Page)**: "Alex lands on our platform. The design is modern, professional, and inspiring."
* **(Register/Login)**: "He creates an account in seconds."
* **(Dashboard)**: "He sees an empty dashboard asking for his target role. He selects **Web Developer**."
* **(Assessment)**: "He checks off the skills he knows. He knows HTML and JS, but missed 'React' and 'Git'."
* **(Results)**: "Boom! Instantly, he gets a **Readiness Score of 65%**. 
    - The **Radar Chart** visually shows he is strong technically but weak in Tools.
    - Below, the **Personalized Roadmap** generates specific modules: 'Learn Git', then 'Master React'."

## 3. Tech & Future (30s)
"We built this using Next.js and a Node.js backend with a custom scoring engine.
In the future, we plan to integrate **Resume Parsing** to auto-fill skills and **AI Course Recommendations** to link directly to learning content.
JobReady.AI doesn't just tell you what you're missing—it tells you how to fix it."

"Thank you!"
